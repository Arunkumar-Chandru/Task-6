## ðŸ“Œ Topic Overview
This project is a **To-Do List application** built in Java using the Swing GUI toolkit.  
It allows users to manage daily tasks through a simple graphical interface with options to **add** and **delete** tasks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The objective of this project is to implement a **Java-based GUI** that helps users keep track of their tasks efficiently.

## âœ… What I Have Done
- Created a **JFrame-based** window to hold all components.
- Used **JTextField** for task input.
